Automated Market Makers (AMMs) is the answer by the DeFi industry to Central Limit Order Books. AMMs provide a decentralized, permissionless way of trading tokens without the need to subdue oneself to a central authority of control.

AMMs consist of liquidity pools that hold the available liquidity of the underlying tradable assets. This liquidity is provided by users (the so-called “liquidity providers”) who are incentivized to do so by the prospect of earning rewards from the fees generated by trades in the pool.

In the case of AMMs, any user can execute a Buy or Sell order on top of a given trading pool. The price of a trade is determined on the spot by a deterministic algorithm which takes as input the relationship between the liquidity of the traded assets, together with other factors which depend on the particular AMM implementation in question.

## Slippage {#slippage}

When a trade is executed, users may experience a common side-effect of the AMM known as `slippage`. This is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price when the trade is actually executed.

Slippage is determined by the amount of liquidity available within the trading pool. If there is a low amount of liquidity provided for the asset, then the slippage percentage when transacting with big orders will be higher.

## Providing Liquidity {#lp}

Thanks to the decentralized manner of an AMM, anyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) for a pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in return for an LP share.

LPs are rewarded with fees for providing this liquidity based on the trading activity experienced by this individual liquidity pool that they have selected to LP for.

## Impermanent Loss (IL) {#impermanent-loss}

A risk faced by LPs is called Impermanent loss (or divergence loss).

This is the risk of the difference in value between holding tokens in an AMM liquidity pool and holding them in your wallet.

Liquidity pools consist of multiple tokens (usually two) paired together in a pool. IL occurs when the tokens inside the pool diverge in price. The greater the divergence, the greater the risk of negative returns for the pool's LPs.

The risk is referred to as "impermanent" because the loss is only realized when you withdraw your tokens from the pool. If the relative prices of tokens in the pool return to their original state when you deposited tokens, the loss is minimized or eliminated.

The losses become *permanent* the moment you withdraw your tokens, reducing your earnings and sometimes wiping out your entire share of profits. 

As such, LPs need to weigh the fees and rewards earned from being a LP versus simply holding your tokens in your wallet.
