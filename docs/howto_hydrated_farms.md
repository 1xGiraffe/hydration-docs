With Hydrated Farms, providing liquidity to selected assets is incentivized by additional rewards on top of rewards from trading fees. To learn more, please visit the [dedicated product page](/omnipool_hydrated_farms).

## 00 Navigate to Liquidity Page
[https://app.hydradx.io/liquidity](https://app.hydradx.io/liquidity)

## 01 Provide Liquidity
Incentivized assets can be identified by the `Farm rewards` section which displays all available rewards for a given farm.

To join a farm, you must first provide liquidity ([step-by-step guide here](/howto_lp)).

# 02 Join Farm
Once you have provided liquidity for an incentivized asset, you can join its farm.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img alt="metadata" src={useBaseUrl('/howto_hydrated_farms/join_farm.jpg')} width="500px" />
</div>

To do so, click on `Join farms` (located next to your liquidity position) and sign the transaction using your wallet app.

Happy hydrated farming!
