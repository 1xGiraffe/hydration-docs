Welcome to brief introduction to development with HydraDX.

By reading this introductory tutorial, you should have good understanding of Hydra project, its purpose, design and implementation details as well.


By the end, you should be able to develop your own pallet on top of hydra or to extend Hydra.

This tutorial assumes previous Substrate and Rust knowledge.

We encourage and support the following course to obtain and learn Substrate fundamentals.

[Acala Runtime Developer Academy](https://www.industryconnect.org/substrate-runtime-developer-academy/)

To learn Rust - [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

Of course, if you have any (and really any!) question - you can contact HydraDX team directly.
