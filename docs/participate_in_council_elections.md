Enter the amount of tokens you are willing to lock in support of your candidates.

After that, select your preferred candidates by clicking on their names. Remeber to select multiple candidates - this will help the algorithm select the optimal distribution of candidates to the Council.

:::note
Locked tokens cannot be transferred, however they can still be used for staking and voting in referenda. Your tokens will remain lucked and used for subsequent elections until you have decided to unlock them.
