title: Run your own collator
---

This is a step-by-step how-to so you can get your HydraDX collator up and running. In this guide, we use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Create a technical `hydra` user and add it to Sudoers

```bash
sudo adduser hydra
sudo usermod -aG sudo hydra
su - hydra
```

## Download and configure the `hydradx` binary

Pick a release, for instance, let's use the latest release to date (11.2.1) from our assets repository:

```bash
wget https://github.com/galacticcouncil/HydraDX-node/releases/download/v11.2.1/hydra-dx
sudo mv hydra-dx /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hydra-dx
sudo chown hydra:hydra /usr/local/bin/hydra-dx

```

## Generate your keys!

In order to generate keys for your node. To do so, run the following set of commands to install the `subkey` command:

```bash
curl https://getsubstrate.io -sSf | bash -s -- --fast
cargo install --force subkey --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate --version 2.0.1 --locked
```

Once done, you can generate your keys:

```bash
subkey generate
```

Put the generated private key in the `node-key`  file under `~/.node-config/`, and store the rest safely!

## Command to run your collator

Best is to run your collator as a `service` using `systemctl`. To do so, create a file, namely `hydradx-collator.service` under `/etc/systemd/system/hydradx-collator.service`:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/hydradx-collator.service
```

Then paste the following:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=hydradx validator
[Service]
Type=exec
User=hydra
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/hydradx \
    --name YOUR_COLLATOR_NAME \
    --base-path /var/lib/hydradx \
    --prometheus-external \
    --node-key-file ~/.node-config/node-key \
    --collator \
    --telemetry-url "wss://telemetry.hydradx.io:9000/submit/ 0" \
    -- \
    --execution wasm \
    --name YOUR_COLLATOR_NAME \
    --base-path /var/lib/hydradx
    
Restart=always
RestartSec=120
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Before starting your node, let's create the base-path folder and give it the necessary permissions and ownership:

```bash
mkdir /var/lib/hydradx
chown hydra:hydra /var/lib/hydradx
```

/!\ Make sure you have enough volume for your `base-path` by using `df -h`command.

Note that `--prometheus-external` is optional, but we highly recommend it so you can be able to export prometheus metrics and monitor your node's health through Grafana. For more details about monitoring, please visit [this link](https://docs.hydradx.io/node_monitoring/).

Depending on your setup, you might also want to override certain parameters like the websocket, rpc or your node p2p port. Please use `hydra-dx --help` for more information about the available options.

After saving your file, run the following commands to start your node:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start hydradx-collator.service
```

And voil√† ! Your node should be up and running now. Make sure your `hydra` user has the necessary permissions to access your `base-path` and key file.

If you need to troubleshoot your running service, you can use the `journalctl` with `-f` option for tailing command as follows:

```bash
journalctl -u hydradx-collator -f 
```

## Inject your keys!

We're nearly done! Once your node is running, and you made sure that it is connected to the network, you can inject your keys, that you generated from the previous step. First, create a file, `inject.json` and paste the following while making sure to replace `SECRET_SEED` and `PUBLIC_KEY(HEX)` with your own values:

``` json
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "id":1,
  "method":"author_insertKey",
  "params": [
    "aura",
    "SECRET_SEED",
    "PUBLIC_KEY(HEX)"
  ]
}
```

Last step, run the following command and you're done!

```bash
curl http://localhost:9933 -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d "@./inject.json"
```

Check your node logs, and make sure it is properly syncing. Congrats! You're officially a ssssnek!
