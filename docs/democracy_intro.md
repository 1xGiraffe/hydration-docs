HydraDX is in the process of fully decentralizing its governance. All decisions which affect the protocol are adopted following a democratic process which is supported by the Substrate governance module. The central mechanism for establishing consensus among the stakeholders is the **referendum**.

This article provides detailed information on [how referenda work](#referenda). It also sheds light on two important groups of actors in the governance mechanism: the [HydraDX Council](#council) and the [Technical Committee](#technical-committee).

If you are looking for practical guidance on how to participate in the governance of HydraDX, please refer to the step-by-step guides on [participating in referenda](/participate_in_referenda) and [participating in Council elections](/participate_in_council_elections).
